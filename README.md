simplesudoku
============

Description
-----------
A simple sudoku game made in Javascript.
Made this in a hurry (few hours) as part of an internship interview process for a startup. Did make it through but was later informed that they couldn't run this because I hadn't packed a local copy of jQuery with the files.

Usage
-----
Simply open the sudoku.html file in any standard web browser.
